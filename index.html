						Simple to do, and it help change this default association of people in tech equaling "he."

						Non cis-male folks will notice you are doing it and it telegraphs a value of an inclusive culture.

				        This is one of my heros Shonda Rhimes. She is an award winning creator of many television shows like Grey's Anatomy, Private Practice, Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder, Station 19 and many others.

					<h2>Diversity for <strike>diversity's</strike> normalizing's sake</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						"Diversity for diversity's sake" implies you're assembling an artificial group of people just for the sake of diversity. Instead of "Diversity for diversity's sake," it should be Diversity for Normalizing's sake. Reality is diverse. Homogeneity is a world like the Smurfs and we all know that is not real.

						In a Yale University randomized double-blind study, 127 US STEM professors asked to evaluate resumes. Resumes were identical, except half "John" and half "Jennifer". Participants rated John significantly more competent and hire-able than Jennifer. And the ones would hire Jennifer offered 13% less in salary than John.
