There is no such thing as perfection, we all make mistakes. Getting to know people not like you and making new friends is fun. Expanding your networks is beneficial and life enriching.

					<h2>Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hire-able than the (identical) female applicant.</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						In a Yale University randomized double-blind study, 127 US STEM professors asked to evaluate resumes. Resumes were identical, except half "John" and half "Jennifer". Participants rated John significantly more competent and hire-able than Jennifer. And the ones would hire Jennifer offered 13% less in salary than John.

						The most disturbing part of this study was the gender of the professor reviewing the resume had no affect on how the resume was rated. This proves we all have bias no matter who we are.
